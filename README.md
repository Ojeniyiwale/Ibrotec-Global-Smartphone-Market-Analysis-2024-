# Ibrotec-Global-Smartphone-Market-Analysis-2024-![Dashboard 3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e41b3a9-7dd4-4909-b964-83fd18e34d4e)

A comprehensive analysis and visualization of global smartphone market trends, competitive landscapes, and future projections. This repository contains data-driven insights into market shares, consumer preferences, and emerging technologies shaping the smartphone industry worldwide.
Project Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of student performance across various demographic and academic factors. The study investigates correlations between student performance metrics (math, reading, writing, and aggregate scores) and predictor variables including gender, race/ethnicity, parental education level, lunch type, and test preparation.
Key Objectives

Identify significant correlations between student performance and demographic/academic factors
Examine the impact of parental education level, lunch type, and test preparation on student performance
Provide evidence-based recommendations for educators and policymakers

Dataset
The analysis utilizes a student performance dataset from Kaggle containing:

Demographics: Gender, race/ethnicity
Socioeconomic factors: Parental education level, lunch type
Academic interventions: Test preparation completion status
Performance metrics: Math, reading, writing scores, and aggregate score

Key Findings

Gender Disparities: Males scored higher in math (68.73% vs 63.63%), while females outperformed in writing (72.47% vs 63.31%) and reading (72.61% vs 65.47%)
Parental Education: Students with higher-educated parents consistently achieved better scores
Economic Factors: Students receiving standard lunch scored 104.52% higher on average than those with free/reduced lunch
Test Preparation: Students who completed test preparation outperformed non-participants by 107.23%â€“95.97% across subjects
Analysis Techniques
The analysis was conducted using Excel and Python, employing:

Excel: PivotTables, AVERAGE/SUM functions, conditional formatting, advanced formulas
Python: pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib/seaborn for visualization

Recommendations

Gender-specific Support:

Provide targeted math support for female students
Encourage male students to engage more in writing and reading activities


Parental Engagement:

Organize workshops for parents to better support children's learning
Provide additional resources to students from less-educated families


Nutritional Support:

Expand free/subsidized lunch programs
Educate students on the importance of nutrition for academic performance


Test Preparation:

Integrate test preparation into the curriculum
Provide free test preparation resources for low-income students
